# GitFitCode Pair Coding Challenge!

### Let's write some code to determine who wins a TicTacToe game!

The **main objective** is to alert the user to who has won the game. Feel free to do this by actually altering the user or displaying it within the game some where nicely.  As you will see, there is already an index.html and style.css file setup for y'all. **PLEASE** do not look for solutions online! This is only hurting yourself and the rest of the team. Please use the README.md file to describe the code so other developers know how everything works and maybe some points on future goals.

*Bonus Points:*

Style the game to make it more appealing! After you get done with the core features, maybe you can write out some desired features in the README.md

**Due Date:** 7/10/2020

Please submit a zip file to the check ins channel!

##### Here are some pointers:

* Support each other! Make sure that y'all really breakdown these problems into managable parts that you can solve. It is a lot easier to solve a bunch of tiny problems vs a large one.

* Make sure to use proper styling and to comment your code!

* Remember this is a team effort! Encourage each other, and really make sure to support each other.

* Before sovling any problem, really breakdown all the rules. Maybe even play a couple games so you can easily describe it.

* Identify the winning moves and store them. Since there is a list of possible winning games, which is a list of moves, how would think to store this?

* Remember you have 2 players and you want to keep track of their moves.

* How does a Draw happen? Make sure to alert the user when this happens as well!

* How do you get access to each element to make the "X" or the "O" appear on the screen?

* Feel free to contact @GitFitDev or @Sirrele for assitance! I hope y'all have fun doing this together!
